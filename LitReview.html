<h1> The evolution of web security </h1> 
<div style="text-align:left;"> 
<p> <U> <strong>Introduction </strong> </U> </p>
<p> It is no doubt web security has increasingly become a very important issue in this day and age especially as in the past the demand for greater security measures were needed on the web. Due to the risk of everyone having a social network account, where details of vulnerable people are put on risk and kids from a very early age are exposed to the pornography on the internet, it does seem without web security many services that are available to us today would not be possible.  In 1998 a policy was produced to stop data falling into the wrong hands called the Data Protection Act, for example the mobile company Orange breached the Data Protection Act as they had not kept personal information secure from staff who were allowed to share usernames and passwords from the company ICT system, (BBC News, 2007). Luckily the company were fortunate to not receive a penalty but however to sign an undertaking to comply with the rules, to make sure the company fully understand the terms and conditions of the legislation. Security measures such as encryption and firewalls are being put in place to protect data on the web.  Online banking was put at risk and was not seen as safe, where businesses private documents could be put on show.  </p>

<p> <U> <strong>Web security with appropriate ages/targetting </strong> </U> </p>
<p> Targeting appropriate ages is a very important and sensitive topic due to the younger audience having accessibility to the web. Due to the rapid growth of teenagers having access to the web, they are therefore more likely to come in contact with pornography early in their life. One of the main concerns is pornography, due to the rapid number of teenagers exposed to this so early in their life. Pornographic material can be posted on the web, (Behr, R, 2013). If pornographic images were posted onto a social network site for example, where a lot of young people have joined, then all their friends are able to see, this could upset a lot of people and shouldnt be in the viewing of teenagers. Security measures are needed, such as internet providers allowing that option to give a choice weather or not to block adult content. (Behr, R, 2013), claimed that last Year TalkTalk became the first internet provider to give customers that choice to block adult content or not. The disadvantage is, these actions only occurred very recently, before this, there was literally nothing put in place to protect young people from pornography, however at least we can say the web is evolving.  </p>
<p> An example, where web security should be controlled for teenagers is on this YouTube clip where it is supposed to be for over people eighteen; however people under that age can still access the videos, as you have to make an account but anyone can lie about their age. Without these, younger audiences will be watching things not meant for them. For example (William E.Schmidt ,1993) wrote an article about two ten year old boys who had kidnapped a toddler when shopping, and then tied him to a train track because they copied film which they had watched a week before involving the same scenario. The Film was intended to be an eighteen, however the boys were ten. So if people do not traffic and monitor web content then it could have dangerous consequences for young people, this is why web security is very important because everyone has access to internet even kids from the age of four. </p> 

<p> <U> <strong>Security methods such as Encryption and firewalls  </strong> </U> </p>
<p> Security methods such as encryption and firewalls are put in place to protect users by not getting tricked by mischievous people on the web.  Encryption is transferring data into a code in which it is only understood by the receiving person.  A limitation of encryption is, if it is used for the wrong purposes. Terrorist groups for example may use encryption as a way to communicate with each other. (NBC News, 2013), recently it was said that a new mobile encryption software is going to give jihadists an edge over the western intelligence forces which has been released by an Islamist group which produces propaganda for terrorist groups. In todays era, the web has produced many opportunities, as anybody could create software for it to be accessible for a wide range of people; this has made it possible for terrorist groups to communicate through encryption.  The way encryption was originally used for secret communication between governments in the past, to now being used by anyone, the web in todays society has created a risk, where it is getting harder to detect everyones conversations.</p> 
<p> The second type of security method is anti-Phishing. Phishing is used to deceive users and obtain personal and sensitive data from publishing websites and sending emails, (Nadi N and Ronald L. K, 2011, p.189). Anti-phishing methods, are put in place to try and help vulnerable users of the web, who get attacked by malicious threats which are caused by hackers who set up, fake websites or emails on the web where once clicked on it steals valuable data from the users, which could be sold to companies for a lot of money. Due to rapid of people who use email nowadays, it is no doubt that many still do not acknowledge the term phishing, which could be very dangerous for people as it could mean a lot of peoples bank details are stolen, or privacy issues such as identity theft on the web. </p> 
<p> The third type of security method is firewalls. Firewalls are used to restrict information to certain ports, (Nadi N and Ronald L.K, 2011, p. 174). Therefore firewalls are seen to protect information going to a network without the approved access permissions. The web has transformed where users are concerned every time they connect to the internet which is completely different to the past, where users use to go onto the web freely without that hassle. Even though some users may be working whilst not using the web, some may still have firewall precautions to increase the security of their computer, not allowing any information to be transferred over the web, by any hackers.  </p>
<p> <U> <strong>Online banking  </strong> </U> </p>
<p> Online banking was started recently on the web, before this, people had to monitor their balance and expenditure on paper, receiving paper statements etc.  Also not getting a 24/7 immediate check-ups available from anywhere with an internet access. Due to the web starting to place stronger security such as private passwords and accounts, user authentication, we can truly say that online banking has become much safer than before. Passwords are given to members of companies who want to use the features for online. To make a password secure it needs to be changed monthly, quarterly or in intervals, (Nadi N and Ronald L. K, 2011, p.194). This is to make sure, that the password could not easily be guessed by people who are looking to commit serious crimes like fraud or hackings. It is also important, passwords contain letters and symbols to make passwords more secure. Passwords should not be given through the web, by email or anything. Especially by the raise of phishing emails sent, anyone could easily pretend to be a member of a large bank, where they demand for account details, causing risk to their online account. </p> 
<p> The second type of security businesses needs to deal with in order to make online banking successful is authentication, without these web security measures put in place then online banking would be impossible, big businesses which users rely on every day for checking up on finances couldnt work. People who may securely need their money on bank holidays would be in trouble as well. Authentication is a process of verification of evidence of an entitys identity, (Nadi N and Ronald L. K, 2011, p.193). This means before any online banking commences, the users of the facilities need to provide sufficient evidence which their banks require of their personal details, needing a series of evidence that you are the owner of the account such as passport etc. Before account holders can start using the web, they need to give all authentications and it needs to be accepted by the bank, this is a secure process in order to control who is using the account. </p> 
<p> <U> <strong>Conclusion  </strong> </U> </p>
<p> Without a doubt web security has a tremendous impact on computing.  However in conclusion, my three examples with online banking, monitoring and trafficking of web content (appropriate targeting) and encryption, firewall and anti-phishing are a few examples on how web security helps protect many users. The most important theme reflected through the essay is that the security methods which are discussed such as encryption, anti-phishing, and firewalls. Users need to be cautious that there are a lot of methods put in place to protect themselves, without this knowledge, hackers are always a greater step ahead of the users of the web. </p>
